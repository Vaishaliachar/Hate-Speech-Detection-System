# Hate-Speech-Detection-System-using-NLP and Deep Learning
Hate Speech Detection System using NLP and Deep Learningâ€“ Built an LSTM-based deep learning model to classify social media text into Hate Speech, Offensive, and Neutral categories. Implemented NLP preprocessing and achieved improved accuracy over traditional ML models for detecting cyberbullying in code-mixed data


## Technologies Used
- Python (3.7+)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

## How It Works
1. Preprocess dataset (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
2. Convert text to sequences using word embeddings.
3. Train LSTM model for sequence classification.
4. Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Achieved improved accuracy in detecting hate/offensive speech compared to baseline models.
- Model generalizes well to **code-mixed data**.

## Future Work
- Extend to multi-lingual datasets.
- Deploy as API for real-time hate speech detection.
